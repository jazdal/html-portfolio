  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am a medical doctor by profession, who happens to love tinkering with computers (and playing a lot of video games) in my spare time. Coding is one of the hobbies I really enjoy, because it involves building stuff up, and I don't really need anything else for that other than my computer (and a good Internet connection).</p>
  <p>I am currently studying Web Development, discovering the joy of creating websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I don't really have a specific purpose or goal in mind for learning this; I am just enjoying this activity a lot. It feels therapeutic for me to know a skill that is very different from my daily job; it allows me to reset my brain and to think outside the box.</p>
  <p>I discovered that coding has helped improve my thinking process. I learned to think logically when solving problems, and coding also helped a lot with improving my memory. I also developed more patience and resilience in dealing with problems, and to keep trying until I find the right solution. I plan to keep this hobby going for as long as I can. Whatever opportunities or doors it may open up for me in the future, I'll just consider a bonus. ðŸ˜Š</p>
