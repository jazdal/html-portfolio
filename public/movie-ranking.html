  <h1>The Best Movies According to Jasper</h1>
  <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

  <h3>Full Metal Jacket</h3>

  <p>
    This is a classic 1987 war drama directed by the late, great Stanley Kubrick. It is about a young group of recruits who underwent the trials and tribulations of Marine training, and were later on subjected to the atrocities of the Vietnam War. R. Lee Ermey delivered an excellent performance as the drill instructor, and Vincent D'Onofrio was my favorite among the recruits as Private Pyle.

  <h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>

  <p>
    Based on the high-fantasy book trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien, director Peter Jackson brought the story to life in a grand way, and also raised the bar for computer visual effects that ushered into the next era of film making. The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King are movies that one will never get tired of watching due to the wonder and awe they inspire, despite having a combined play length of over 9 hours with the extended editions.

  <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>

  <p>
    Released in 2008, this movie was directed by Christopher Nolan and is a sequel to Batman Begins. Actor Christian Bale reprised his role as Batman, and the late Heath Ledger delivered a stunning performance as the diabolical and unpredictable Joker. I loved Ledger's portrayal of Joker, he really looked unhinged and you never knew what his next move was going to be.
